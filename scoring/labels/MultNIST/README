The MultNIST dataset is a constructed dataset from MNIST Images. The intention of this dataset is to require machine learning models to do more than just image classification but also perform a calculation, in this case multiplaction following by a mod. For each image, three MNIST Images were randomly chosen and combined together through the colour channels, resulting in a three colour-channel image so each MNIST image represents one colour channel. 

The data is in a channels-first format with a shape of (n, 3, 28, 28) where n is the number of samples in the corresponding set (50,000 for training, 10,000 for validation, and 10,000 for testing).

There are ten classes in the dataset, with 7,000 examples of each, distributed evenly between the three subsets.

The label of each image is generated using the formula "(r * b * g) % 10" where r, g, and b are the red, green, and blue colour channels respectively. An example of a MultNIST Image would be a rgb configuation of 3, 7, and 4 respectively, which would result in a label of 4 ((3 * 7 * 4) % 10).

The six files containing the dataset are the NumPy (.npy) files. These files can be opened through the NumPy Python library, using the `numpy.load()` function by inputting the path to the file into the function as a parameter. The metadata file contains some basic information about the datasets, and can be opened in many text editors such as vim, nano, notepad++, notepad, etc.
